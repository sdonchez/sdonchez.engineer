								I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Villanova
								University's College of Engineering between August of 2016 and May of
								2020. During this time, I also completed a minor in Computer Science, and
								worked on <a href="#/projects">a number of intresting projects</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Engineering at
								Villanova, and anticipate completing this degree in Spring of 2022. I
								intend to research Embedded Systems design and FPGA security during my
								time in this program.
							</p>
							<p>
								Outside of my curricular activities at Villanova, I've been heavily
								involved in Villanova University Tech Crew, an on campus event production
								company. Additionally, I've <a href="#/work">worked</a> for Villanova's
								Department of Environmental Health and Safety, providing web and asset
								management, database development and administration, and assorted related
								services.

								From 2012 to 2016, I attended Lehigh Valley Academy Regional Charter
								School for my high school degree. LVA is actually a K-12 Charter School,
								and I attended there for all 13 years of my primary and secondary
								education.
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to my traditional high school diploma, LVA afforded me the
								opportunity to recieve an International Baccalureate Diploma through the
								<a href="https://ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/" target="_blank"
									>IB Diploma Programme</a
								>. This comprehensive program stressed a balance of liberal arts and STEM
								courses, while also putting an emphasis on community service and
								individual research.
							</p>
							<p>
								Outside of class, a large portion of my time in High School at LVA was
								occupied by a club I was heavily invested in, the
								<a href="https://tsaweb.org/" target="_blank"
									>Technology Student Association.</a
								>
								As a member of TSA, I worked to create unique physical products, as well
								as develop my problem solving skills. I also served as the Pennsylvania
								State Historian for the organization. This position required me to produce
								all multimedia content for the statewide organization, as well as work
								alongside the other 7 state officers to plan and execute our 2,000 person
								state conference.
