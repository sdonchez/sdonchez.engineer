								The summer after my sophomore year of college, I interned with what was
								then Harris Corporation (now L3Harris Technologies) as a software
								engeering intern. In this role, I aided in the development of embedded
								software across all phases of the design process, from operating
								environment configuration to application development to testing and
								authoring documentation.
							</p>
							<p>
								I returned to Harris the following summer as a systems engineering intern,
								and performed extensive work conducting a risk management analysis of an
								electronic warfare (EW) system. I also assisted the software team by
								authoring and performing a number of unit and integration tests on several
								EW systems to aid in certifying equipment prior to its release, as well as
								testing several options for operationg environment configuration and
								deployment automation. On a more traditional systems engineering note, I
								also aided in the production of design documentation for a new EW
								platform.
							</p>
							<p>
								I anticipate returning to L3Harris (which rebranded as a result of a
								merger last summer) this coming summer, once again as a systems
								engineering intern.

								Throughout my time in college, I have been heavily involved in Villanova
								University Tech Crew, a one of a kind on-campus event production
								organization. VUTC provides high quality Audio, Lighting, and Video
								production services to the Villanova Community at affordable rates, and is
								heavily involved in almost every event that occurs on campus. Notable
								events VUTC provides services for include the freshman orientation
								program, Special Olympics Fall Festival (the largest student run special
								olympics event in the world), NOVAdance (a 12 hour dance marathom to
								benefit pediatric cancer patients), and A Capella Palooza (a student A
								Capella showcase featuring full concert-style production).
							</p>
							<p>
								My first leadership position in VUTC was in the spring of my freshman
								year. At that time, I began serving as VUTC's Events Manager, a role which
								required me to meet with clients, determine their needs, generate and
								provide them with a quote, and coordinate logistic for each event. The
								following year, I served as Vice-President, which presented many of the
								same responsabilities, but for all of the large scale events on campus. I
								then continued to serve as the organization's president the following
								year, which made me directly responsible for both the day to day
								operations and the long term development of the $70,000/year organization.
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to these leadership roles, I am one of VUTC's several Head
								Technicians. In this capacity, I manage the setup, operation, and
								tear-down of complex audio, video, and lighting systems at events of all
								scales. In this role, I am directly responsible for supervising a staff of
								up to 25 people, as well as interfacing with clients and other university
								resources such as public safety, facilities management, and operations
								staff.

								Since my freshman year of college, I have worked with the university's
								department of environmental health and safety, providing a wide variety of
								technical services (and some decidedly less technical ones, such as
								testing safety showers). I began my time with the department aiding in the
								generation of presentation aids and similar content. However, shortly
								after becoming an employee, I was assigned the responsibility of
								redesigning the department's website to facilitate easier navigation and
								improve cohesion with the greater university's site.
							</p>
							<p>
								From there, I transitioned to an extensive period of database work, in
								which I created a number of database applications for tracking various
								aspects of the university's operations. These applications were based on
								Microsoft Access, and included comprehensive authentication and auditing
								capabilities in addition to the usual data input report generation
								capabilities.
							</p>
							<p>
								Recently, I've been working with the department in conjunction with
								another student worker to develop an in house chemical asset management
								solution. That project (and others) is described in detail on my
								<a href="#/projects">projects page</a>.

								I've been involved in the martial arts since I was 6 years old (see my
								<a href="#/interests">interests page</a> for more). When I entered high
								school, I was given the position of Junior Instructor at Hoover Karate
								Academy. In this role, I served as an assistant instructor in classes of
								all sizes, age groups, and experience levels. When I turned 18, I was
								promoted to the rank of "Junior-Senior Instructor", and began teaching my
								own classes. I greatly enjoying working with the "junior" or teenaged
								students, however I have also taught classes from pre-k through adult.
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to my role as instructor, I also worked for HKA in the
								capacity of a customer service representative in the school's office and
								retail store. Here, I processed transactions for customers, handled
								tuition payment and attendance tracking, and also enrolled new students in
								the school.
							</p>
							<p>
								I also served as the school's information technology support. In this
								role, I assisted in the maintenance of the school's website, and also
								authored a Microsoft Access based database application for managing
								student enrollment, promotion, and billing. This software solution
								alleviated the need for hours of tedious work every month maintaining
								hand-written records of student progress and payments.
