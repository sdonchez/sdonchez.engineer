		<p>My degree says I have a bachelor's of science in Computer Engineering and a
			minor in Computer Science. But that's just a small part of who I am. Sure,
			I'm passionate about embedded systems, and am looking forward to putting my
			knowledge of software development, FPGAs, and the latest in embedded security
			work. But I'm also a 3rd degree black belt, a live event technician with 4 
			years experience in Audio, Video, and Lighting for events of all sizes, and an
			avid ball-thrower whenever my dog asks. I encourage you to take a moment to 
			explore who I am (in digital form), and to reach out with any questions!

			You can also download my <a href="#">resume</a> or visit me on <a href="#">
			LinkedIn</a> to learn more about my academic and professional activities.
