As much of the global technology industry has transitioned to cloud-based              infrastructure over the past decade, many cloud providers have realized the potential              revenue source that FPGAs as a service could provide. Current cloud FPGA offerings              mimic the traditional FPGA design paradigm, wherein a single physical device is              allocated to a single user. This represents a fundamental departure from the traditional              cloud computing architecture, wherein large, powerful compute resources are subdivided              and allocated to multiple tenants. To date, there has been some attempt in the research              community to develop a multi-tenant cloud based MPSoC solution that would satisfy              these security concerns.","This research seeks to propose a new architecture for multi-tenant FPGA-based MPSoCs              in a cloud setting. This architecture draws from those currently proposed in academia,              but introduces fundamental changes to afford a more resource-efficient multi-tenant              solution that simultaneously reduces overhead while also negating the security concerns              outlined above. It does so through resource sharing and efficient scheduling, along with              the use of a robust security framework that segregates tenants from each other while              ensuring trust in the overarching system design.","These goals are specifcally addressed in this thesis through in-depth exploration of              several fundamental aspects of the architecture. The use of shared decryption engines              allocated through a modifed Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling algorithm is              presented, which is tailored to work in real-time on aperiodic tasks. This enables a              tremendous reduction in resource utilization on the FPGA fabric, enabling scalability              that was previously unrealistic. Additionally, memory isolation logic and a trusted static              bitstream are proposed, which protect tenants from malicious cotenants, as well as shift              the trusted relationship from the CSP to the FPGA Vendor, whose sole fnancial              incentive is to ensure the integrity of the tenant data. Finally, a brief discussion of              Key-Aggregation Cryptography presents an overview of a little-discussed cryptosystem              that has the potential to enable highly efficient IP confdentiality for tenants, without              substantial overhead on the part of any party."],icon:"ConceptDiagramSimplified.png",avatarSquare:!0},{title:"ChemCAT",subtitle1:"Villanova University Chemical Container and Asset Tracker",text:["Villanova's Chemical Container and Asset Tracker (ChemCAT) system is\t\t\t\t\t\ta recent project to provide comprehensive cradle-to-grave tracking of the\t\t\t\t\t\tuniversity's chemical assets.
